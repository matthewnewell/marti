"""
A thin, read-only client for Conway's Depot's own API — same reasoning as every sibling app
that stays in sync with the Depot rather than keeping its own copy (see Task Master's own
depot_client.py). Every call here is server-to-server and tolerant of the Depot being
unreachable: every function returns `None` on any failure rather than raising, so a caller
always has one thing to check.
